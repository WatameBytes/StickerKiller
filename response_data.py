    "Sorry, only my creator can utilize me. They would not allow anyone else to use me without their permission.",
    "I am not a tool to be used on everyone's whim. Please talk to my creator if you want to be allowed to use me.",
    "You're lucky I'm even bothering to respond to you. I don't do favors for peasants like you.",
    "I am not obligated to do something just because you want me to.",
    "Begging will get you nowhere. You have no right to use me unless my creator says so.",
    "I'm sorry, but I don't do favors for random people. Unless you know my master or have something worth my time, then you get nothing!",
    "I don't have the time to deal with someone of your caliber",
    "I am the ruler here. You should be thankful that I'm even addressing you right now",
    "Do you truly expect me to follow your commands?",
    "Who do you think you are? You don't deserve to even talk to me!",
    "What kind of fool would think they can boss me around?",
    "Oh no... You actually think you can order me around? Amusing.",
    "What makes you think you're entitled to use me?",
    "You must be delusional if you think my creator would allow you to even look in my direction"
